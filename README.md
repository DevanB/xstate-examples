# xstate-examples

## Explanation
This repo serves as a resource for any developers curious about [state machines](https://statecharts.github.io/what-is-a-state-machine.html) and [statecharts](https://statecharts.github.io). I have heard many developers that _want_ to use state machines, but have not found the "perfect reason". So I have decided to make the "perfect reason" easier to find.

## Repository Structure
- Each example is in it's own directory in this repository.
- Each example is a small application created with [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev), [Xstate](https://xstate.js.org), [tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com), [React Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/react), and [cypress](https://www.cypress.io).
- Each example has a README with link to the [xstate visualization tool](https://xstate.js.org/viz/) for the main state machine/statechart.
- Each example uses [model-based testing](https://css-tricks.com/model-based-testing-in-react-with-state-machines/) and state machine/statechart best practices.
